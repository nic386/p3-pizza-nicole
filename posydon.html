      Named after the almighty King of the Sea because of his strong, long, blue presence.  Here he is located at his home, New Smyrna Beach, FL.  Although Posydon was a newer diesel, he still made some noise.  This truck helped my parents move out into their new home and me move into mine.  It helped construct many new landscaping endeavours by hauling sod and mulch.  He would even have a ton or two of rocks dumped into the bed for bigger landscape jobs.  Posydon was a hard worker but also could have a good time.  One of my favorite things to do with him was put the exhaust brake on so that it would sound like a dump truck downshifting.
