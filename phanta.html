      Phanta is named after the Orange Soda, "Fanta", but she spells it with a P-H because she is PHAT.  This is the first car I ever owned.  Posydon was traded in because I just bought a house and really needed to save  more money.  The Dodge Charger is the only vehicle I liked that would be able to help me do this.  Although Phanta may be a bit slow because she only has a V6, she still looks good.  People often confuse her color with red, but her actual color is 'Go Mango'.  She is registered as an orange vehicle.  Phanta has done her share of transporting sod also.  No complaints so far!  As Young Jeezy said, ".. in my black and oragne charger, call it trick or treat."
