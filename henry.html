      Henry was built with the greatest diesel motor ever made - the 7.3 liter International Harvester Turbo Diesel.  When I bought Henry he had over 300,000 miles on him, was stock and the cab had about 3" thick of dirt under the vinyl flooring because he was a hard working truck.  I could (should) have left Henry stock, but I spent a year rebuilding him.  Once I did all the mods listed below I would put the chip to performance mode all the time and one day I blew Henry's motor up.  This was one of my saddest days.  I will never forget what it sounded like and what it smelled like (Chinese food).  It was back to the drawing board, but this gave me the opportunity to put in a totally rebuilt 7.3 motor so it was almost like Henry had 0 miles on him.  Over the year I learned a lot about diesel motors and was able to do some creative side projects (like make a wind chime out of his bent rods).  The day I put Henry up for sale someone bought him.  I didn't think he would go so soon especially for what I was asking, but it was time to move on because I spent all my free time researching and working on him.  King Henry will always be my first love.
